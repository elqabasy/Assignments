/*
    8. C++ Program to Find GCD.
        a. The largest integer which can perfectly divide two integers is known as GCD or HCF of those two numbers.
        b. For example, the GCD of 4 and 10 is 2 since it is the largest integer that can divide both 4 and 10.
        Example:
            Enter two numbers:
            16
            76
            HCF = 4
