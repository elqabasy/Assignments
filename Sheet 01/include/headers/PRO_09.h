    9. C++ Program to Check Whether a Number is Prime or Not.
        a. A positive integer which is only divisible by 1 and itself is known as prime number.
        b. For example: 13 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 13 but, 15 is not prime number because it is divisible by 1, 3, 5 and 15.
        Note: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
        Example:
            Enter a positive integer: 29
            29 is a prime number.
