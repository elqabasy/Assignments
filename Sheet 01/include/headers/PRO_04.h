/*
     4. C++ Program to Check Whether Number is Even or Odd.
        a. Integers that are perfectly divisible by 2 are called even numbers.
        b. And those integers that are not perfectly divisible by 2 are not known as odd numbers.
        c. To check whether an integer is even or odd, the remainder is calculated when it is divided by 2 using modulus operator %. If the remainder is zero, that integer is even if not that integer is odd.
        Example
            Enter an integer: 23
            23 is odd.
